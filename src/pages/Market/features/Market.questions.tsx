    title: 'What is Incognito exchange?',
    answer:
      'Incognito exchange is a one-stop-shop that facilitates anonymous swap for all coins across many popular blockchains such as Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, etc. While every existing DEX has its own drawback: sufficient liquidity but no privacy or privacy supported but shortage liquidity, Incognito exchange takes a novel approach to achieve both by implementing privacy via zero-knowledge proofs, inter-blockchain trading with huge liquidity via interoperable dApps (a.k.a DEXs such as Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap and SpookySwap).',
  },
  {
    title: 'What is Incognito wallet extension?',
    answer:
      'Incognito wallet extension is a crypto wallet compatible with Incognito blockchain. It allows users to manage their keychains in a variety of ways while isolating them from the site context. With Incognito wallet extension, you can easily store, send and receive funds on the Incognito blockchain. Additionally, you can also use the wallet extension for signing a transaction requesting from privacy app websites.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Why must I install Incognito wallet extension in order to use swap function from the Incognito website?',
    answer:
      'Incognito wallet extension is used for signing a swap transaction requesting from the Incognito website then submitting the signed transaction to an Incognito fullnode for executing the swap. The swapped coins will then be populated in the wallet extension so that you can manage or send the coins over Incognito blockchain.',
  },
  {
    title: 'Where does liquidity come from?',
    answer:
      'Incognito exchangeâ€™s liquidity comes from two sources:\n1. Native privacy DEX (pDEX) for pools containing coins from non smart contract blockchains such as PRV, BTC, XMR, ZEC, LTC and DASH.\n2. Integrated external DEXes such as Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap and SpookSwap.',
  },
  {
    title: 'What are swap fees?',
    answer: 'The swap fee will depend on what liquidity pool a swap is executed with.',
